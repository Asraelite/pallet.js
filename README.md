# pallet.js
Javascript canvas abstraction layer for drawing shapes and simple objects.


Usage
-----

Clone a copy of pallet.js:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/Asraelite/pallet.js.git
```

Include it in your project:

```javascript
<script src="pallet.js"></script>
```

Create a new _Pallet_ object, passing the id of the canvas element you want to use:
```javascript
var pallet = new Pallet('#mycanvas');
```

You may then call the functions of the pallet object to draw different things to the canvas.
